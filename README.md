# Super-80 PCB (V1)

This repository stores the KiCad files (schematic and PCB) for the work-in-progress task of creating a reproduction of the Super 80 Computer.

The schematic is fully drawn.

As at 11-OCT-2016, the PCB is about 50% completed.

This will be as close a copy as possible to the original design.  Once this board has been completed, a slightly modified version will then be created, to overcome problems associated with components that are no longer available (such as the keyswitches).

STATUS:

11-OCT-2016: Added bottom layer traces in the vicinity of the 3 24-pin ICs U26, U33 and U42.

10-OCT-2016: Initial upload of KiCad files to Github.
